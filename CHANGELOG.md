# signal studio. — changelog

Process notes for the umbrella. The four products keep their own logs;
this one tracks what coalesced across the suite.

### The homepage got sharper.

The hero line changed from "Cut through the noise." to "Project
Management for the 80% who don't work in tech." This is a deliberate
positioning test: clearer category recognition at the top of the page,
while the product still refuses project-management theatre underneath.
Signal HQ now records the test so future agents treat it as intent, not
drift.

### Collaboration became the growth loop.

Signal HQ now has a Collab Loop tab. It tracks the product-led path the
suite has to prove: workspace created, collaborators invited, work made
clearer, shareable output created, new creator discovered. The dashboard
also now carries the shared object model that will keep Tasks, Roadmap,
Analytics, and Notes from drifting into four separate tools.

The plan is written down too. `docs/ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` holds
the cross-product build sequence, and Signal Growth Studio now has a
collaboration growth loop memory file. Collaboration is no longer a
nice-to-have feature. It is the organic outreach campaign.

### Cycle 1 started across the product repos.

Tasks, Roadmap, Analytics, and Notes now each carry their own
collaboration-loop contract. Each product knows its role: execution,
direction, attention, and context. The next work is no longer abstract
"integrate the products"; it is narrower and better: define the invite
path, the guest's first view, the first shareable artefacts, and the
source tracking that proves collaboration can become distribution.

### Signal HQ became the private operating room.

The umbrella now has a private `/hq` route: password-gated, noindex,
absent from public navigation, and built to show the state of Signal
Studio in under a minute. Product readiness, launch readiness, growth
work, outbound, content, demos, templates, pilots, metrics, decisions,
feedback, risks, and next actions now have one internal home.

Signal Growth Studio also entered the repo as memory, not theatre:
campaign notes, brand rules, hooks, objections, demo planning, template
strategy, review gates, and weekly operating rhythm. The public site
stays quiet. The internal system gets serious.

### Claude and Codex got the same operating rule.

Root instruction files now exist for Claude Code and Codex. Both point
back to the repo contract and repeat the rule that meaningful product,
brand, GTM, roadmap, campaign, template, outreach, demo, decision, risk,
or metric changes must update Signal HQ before the work is complete.
The dashboard also notices when repo-backed HQ data is newer than the
browser copy, so local-first does not become local-stale.

### The umbrella stopped being an old portfolio.

The `/work` page now names only the four Signal Studio products. No
client artifacts. No inherited side quests. The page says what the
company is: Signal Tasks, Signal Roadmap, Signal Analytics, Signal
Notes. The contact page now points at `hello@signalstudio.ie`, and the
handbook no longer treats Analytics as a placeholder.

### The umbrella is live.

signalstudio.ie opened today. DNS resolved to Vercel. The apex serves.
What's visible: a choreographed entrance — gold hairline, headline
rising word by word, four product rows entering from both sides on
scroll. The silence between tasks., roadmap., analytics. and the held
beat where notes. would fire — that silence is intentional. The gesture
is the story.

### Notes held in placeholder.

The Notes row dims. Its brand gesture stays quiet in the entrance
sequence. The row is present enough to show the suite is four products;
inert enough to never imply a live product. Opacity carries the honest
weight that copy would oversell.

### The brand handbook became a real artifact.

BRAND.md grew §2 today — audience deep-dive and moat. The moat line
settled: *discipline sustained across the suite*. Not a feature, not
a category. A posture maintained across four products and every piece of
copy that touches them. §2.1–§2.3 locked the three reader archetypes
and the thing that makes the suite defensible: that it stays consistent
when most solo products drift.

### A gesture for Notes entered the visual register.

The notes-mark acquired an underline-writes-itself animation — the
period underlines itself on enter, then disappears, matching how capture
works: you write, then it's gone. That gesture is now in the products-grid
and named in BRAND.md §4 as the canonical visual register source-of-truth
for all four marks. Consistency is a decision made once, held everywhere.

### Favicons travel as a system.

Three products — roadmap, analytics, studio — now share a favicon
architecture derived from the same design logic. The marks read at 32px.
They read at 180px on a home screen. They're the same decision at every
size.

### Security headers closed across all four products.

HSTS, X-Frame enforcement, and CSP report-only landed on every
next.config in the suite simultaneously. The suite operates as a
coherent security boundary, not four independent decisions. Nothing
visible changed. That's the point.

### hello@signalstudio.ie

Domain verified. Google Workspace connected. The address is real.
DKIM generation still owed — the key needs to be created in the Admin
Console before the suite has a fully authenticated sending identity.
